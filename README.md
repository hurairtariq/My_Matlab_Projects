This code shows the comparision between the analytical solution abtained by solving the 1st order linear differential equation and thus obtaining the results of the same equation with the Difference Equation . 
The result from the plot of analytical vs difference equation shows that as we reduce the sampling time (means faster microcortroller or a better code with more iterations per second ) error between 
the exact and numerical solution reduces.
